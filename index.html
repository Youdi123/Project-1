        <h1>Hello, welcome to my home page!</h1>
        <p>At there, I would like to introduce my dogs. I have 4 dogs in my house.</p>
        <p>The first one is a black dog. My father found it in the grass by the road. At that time, she was        very young and looked like just the size of the palm. But now she is very big and fat. </p>

        <p>The second one is a grey dog. The third one is a orange dog.We got them by accident. They came to my    house by themselves. </p>
        <p><img src="../../Pictures/灰狗.jpg"><img src="../../Pictures/橘狗.jpg" width="273" height="360"></p>
        <p>The final one is the son of the orange dog.</p>
